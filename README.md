# AlgebraicSolving.jl

A julia package for algebraically solving multivariate polynomial systems.

## Installation
AlgebraicSolving requires Julia 1.6 or newer. In principle it can be installed and used
like any other Julia package; doing so will take a couple of minutes:

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("AlgebraicSolving")
julia> using AlgebraicSolving
```
